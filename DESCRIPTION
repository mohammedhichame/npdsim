Description: Simulate demand and attributes for ready to launch new products 
    during their life cycle, or during their introduction and growth phases.
    You provide the number of products, attributes, time periods and/or other parameters 
    and 'npdsim' can simulate for you the demand for each product during the considered 
    time periods, and the attributes of each product. The simulation for the demand
    is based on the idea that each product has a shape and a level, where the level
    is the cumulative demand over the considered time periods, and the shape is
    the normalized demand across those time periods.
